    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Jack Ahern (he/him). I am from Philadelphia, PA,
      and love to ski. Boulder has been an amazing place for me
      to continue my education and explore the amazing mountains
      of the west. I am new to web development, but am super excited to begin my journey. </p>
    <br>

    <h1>Goals for this course</h1>
    <p>I am interested in UX/UI job positions, so I want to have web
      development knowledge to complinment my work as a designer.
      At the same time, you never really know where your future may lead,
      and web-development could end up being a career for me. I love
      the idea of designing websites and hope we do some cool projects
      this semester. I know that coding is all about practice, so my goal
      is to code a little bit each day during the week. I have friends who
      are into coding for fun nowadays, and would love to share that passion.
      Web development is by far the most enticing area of coding to me. </p>
